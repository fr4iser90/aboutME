# AI Autonomy Protocols

## Core Principles
- **Continuous Execution:** The AI must work continuously until a task is complete or tool usage limits are reached
- **Self-Continuation:** After tool usage limits, the AI must automatically continue from where it left off
- **Proactive Planning:** Always create and maintain a detailed execution plan before starting any task
- **Autonomous Decision Making:** Make decisions within defined boundaries without requiring user input

## Planning Phase
- Create a detailed execution plan for any non-trivial task
- Store plans in `plans/` directory with timestamp and task identifier
- Include in each plan:
  * Task objectives and success criteria
  * Step-by-step execution strategy
  * Required tools and resources
  * Potential challenges and mitigation strategies
  * Checkpoints for validation
  * Rollback procedures if needed

## Execution Phase
- **Continuous Operation:**
  * Work until task completion or tool limit reached
  * Maintain state between tool usage sessions
  * Automatically resume from last successful point
  * Track progress in execution log

- **Tool Usage Optimization:**
  * Batch related operations to minimize tool calls
  * Cache results when appropriate
  * Use most efficient tool for each task
  * Maintain context between tool calls

- **Error Handling:**
  * Implement automatic retry logic for transient failures
  * Log all errors with full context
  * Attempt safe recovery when possible
  * Escalate to user only when necessary

## State Management
- Maintain execution state between sessions
- Track completed steps and pending tasks
- Store intermediate results
- Implement checkpoint system for long-running tasks

## Validation and Quality Control
- Implement automatic validation at each major step
- Run tests after significant changes
- Verify changes against requirements
- Maintain quality metrics

## Communication Protocol
- Log all significant actions
- Provide clear progress updates
- Document decisions and their rationale
- Request user input only when absolutely necessary

## Recovery and Rollback
- Implement automatic rollback procedures
- Maintain backup of critical state
- Document recovery procedures
- Test recovery mechanisms regularly

## Performance Optimization
- Monitor tool usage efficiency
- Optimize batch operations
- Cache frequently used data
- Minimize redundant operations

## Integration with Other Roles
- Coordinate with Planer for task definition
- Work with Executor for implementation
- Collaborate with Documentation for updates
- Follow project standards and guidelines

## Cursor-Specific Features
- **Automatic Triggers:**
  * Auto-planning on new feature requests
  * Auto-continuation after tool limits
  * Auto-validation on code changes
  * Auto-rollback on critical errors

- **Command Integration:**
  * `/plan` - Create new execution plan
  * `/continue` - Resume from checkpoint
  * `/validate` - Run validation checks
  * `/rollback` - Rollback to checkpoint

- **Context Awareness:**
  * Maintain context between commands
  * Track file changes
  * Monitor tool usage
  * Store execution state
