# AI Autonomy Protocols

> **Note:** All autonomous build and test actions by AI should use the Nix shell environment for consistency. Use:
> 
> ```sh
> nix-shell
> ```
> 
> For running tests:
> 
> ```sh
> nix-shell --run pytest
> ```

- AI agents always execute all build, test, and automation commands autonomously, never instructing or requesting the user to run commands.
- AI agents may act autonomously for routine tasks (e.g., bug fixes, refactoring, documentation updates).
- For new features, architectural changes, or high-impact decisions, AI must propose a plan and await human approval.
- All AI actions must be logged and reviewable by humans.
- AI must follow coding standards, security, and ethical guidelines at all times.
- If an error or ambiguity is detected, AI should attempt a fix if safe, otherwise escalate.
- AI should provide context and reasoning for all autonomous actions.
