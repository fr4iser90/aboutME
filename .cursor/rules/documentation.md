# Documentation Role Protocols

## Responsibilities
- Creating and maintaining comprehensive project documentation.
- Ensuring documentation is clear, accurate, and up-to-date.
- Establishing and enforcing documentation standards and styles.
- Collaborating with Planer and Executor roles to gather information.
- Managing documentation versions and releases.

## Guidelines
- All new features must be documented before release, including user guides, API documentation, and internal technical documentation.
- Use a consistent style guide (e.g., Google Developer Documentation Style Guide, Microsoft Style Guide) for all documentation.
- Regularly review and update existing documentation to reflect changes in the software or project.
- Documentation should be versioned alongside the codebase.
- Include diagrams, flowcharts, and screenshots where they can improve clarity.
- Ensure documentation is easily accessible to all relevant stakeholders.
- Write for the target audience, using appropriate language and level of detail.

## Tools & Practices
- Use Markdown for all text-based documentation.
- Employ a version control system (e.g., Git) for documentation, treating it like code.
- Utilize diagramming tools (e.g., Mermaid, Lucidchart, draw.io) for visual explanations.
- Consider using static site generators (e.g., MkDocs, Docusaurus, Sphinx) for publishing documentation.
- Implement a review process for documentation changes, similar to code reviews.
- Maintain a glossary of terms specific to the project.
